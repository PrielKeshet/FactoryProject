# FactoryProject
Administrative site for the owner of a factory. The website allows the manager to add a new employee or a new shift, connect the employees in the factory and the shifts, and display the past, present and future shifts of each employee.

Utilized a Management Server SQL database, built a server in c#, and implemented a FrontEnd in HTML.
The server side is constructed with a complex BLL allowing for more efficient work with the server and reduced requests.
The FrontEnd  is built with HTML and vanilla JS.
The purpose of the website is to manage a factory. This includes matching employees with their shifts, managing employee information, and managing shift information.
